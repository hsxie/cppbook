PPLU (Plasma Physics Learning Utility) is developed to help beginners to learn and understand the forth state of matter (plasma) more easily and interested. Of course, non-beginners may also benifit from this utility.

Run the utility,
Method 1: open main_pplu.m in matlab editor, press the 'Run(>)' button or 'F5' directly;
Method 2: type 'main_pplu' in the command window and 'Enter' is also OK.

This utility is mainly developed by Hua-sheng XIE at Institute for Fusion Theory and Simulation, Department of Physics, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. But, other people's public nice codes are also integrated.

For examples,
1. N. Lehtinen's plotcma.m for plotting the Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis diagram for cold 2-comp plasma.
2. Anders Tjulin (2003)'s codes for plotting cold plasma wave dispersion surface.
3. Andris Vaivads's  irf_plasma_wave_visualization.m for visualizing cold plasma waves.

Thanks to these original authors.

At this moment, this 1.1 version contents 13 completed (but may be intensified) moudles:

1. Plot the tokamak cross section shape;
2. Plot the B field line in tokamak;
3. Plot the Clemmow-Mullaly-Allis diagram for cold 2-comp plasma;
4. Calculate cold plasma wave dispersion relation & dispersion surface based on D(w,k);
5. Visualize cold plasma waves;
6. Charged particle motion in simple EM field;
7. Particle-in-Cell Simulation, ES1D;
8. The plasma dispersion function Z(z), and the dispersion relation of Langmuir wave (Landau problem);
9. Example of Nyquist diagram;
10. Simple model for adiabatic invariant.
11. Solve the KdV equation for soliton(s) solution;
12. Standard Map;
13. Model for Phase Mixing, Resonantly-Absorbed, Mode-Converted.

and, more moudles are planning.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Note: You'd better have some basic knowledges of the module(s) which you are interested, or have a textbook in hand for referring.

PS:
Andre Jaun (KTH/Stockholm) and Anders Bondeson (CTH/Gothenburg) once have also developed a "MATLAB modules for introductory plasma physics", http://www.lifelong-learners.com/pla/com/. It can be a compared utility, for ones who are interested.
