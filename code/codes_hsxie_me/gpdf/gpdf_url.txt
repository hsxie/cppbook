Abstract
A unified, fast, and effective approach is developed for numerical
calculation of the well-known plasma dispersion function with
extensions from Maxwellian distribution to almost arbitrary
distribution functions, such as the $\delta$, flat top, triangular,
$\kappa$ or Lorentzian, slowing down, and incomplete Maxwellian
distributions. The singularity and analytic continuation problems
are also solved generally. Given that the usual conclusion
$\gamma\propto\partial f_0/\partial v$ is only a rough approximation
when discussing the distribution function effects on Landau damping,
this approach provides a useful tool for rigorous calculations of
the linear wave and instability properties of plasma for general
distribution functions. The results are also verified via a linear
initial value simulation approach. Intuitive visualizations of the
generalized plasma dispersion function are also provided.
