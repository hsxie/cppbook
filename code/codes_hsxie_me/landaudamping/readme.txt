Landau Damping Simulation Models
Hua-sheng Xie, IFTS-ZJU, huashengxie@gmail.com

Abstract:
Several models for Landau damping simulations are provided: the simplest linear model, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation and Vlasov continuity simulation as well as the discussions of the numerical aspects of the dispersion relation.

I hope this tutorial can be useful for beginners to understand the basic physics and numerical methods in plasma physics. It can be used for the undergraduate or graduate courses such as "Introduction to Plasma Physics" or "Computational Plasma Physics". And, it can also be the start point of your researches.

This version of the tutorial (notes and codes) was presented at Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

You can modified/improved them for your own usages. But, you should keep the copyright information. This statement also holds for many of my other codes.
