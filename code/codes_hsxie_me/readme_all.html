Abstract<br>
A unified, fast, and effective approach is developed for numerical
calculation of the well-known plasma dispersion function with
extensions from Maxwellian distribution to almost arbitrary
distribution functions, such as the $\delta$, flat top, triangular,
$\kappa$ or Lorentzian, slowing down, and incomplete Maxwellian
distributions. The singularity and analytic continuation problems
are also solved generally. Given that the usual conclusion
$\gamma\propto\partial f_0/\partial v$ is only a rough approximation
when discussing the distribution function effects on Landau damping,
this approach provides a useful tool for rigorous calculations of
the linear wave and instability properties of plasma for general
distribution functions. The results are also verified via a linear
initial value simulation approach. Intuitive visualizations of the
generalized plasma dispersion function are also provided.<br><br>

Abstract<br>
A general, fast, and effective approach is developed for numerical calculation of kinetic plasma dispersion relations. The plasma dispersion function is approximated by J-pole expansion. Subsequently, the dispersion relation is transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem of an equivalent linear system. The result is accurate for J = 8 except the solutions that are the little interesting heavily damped modes. In contrast to conventional approaches, such as Newton¡¯s iterative method, this approach can give either all the solutions in the system or a few solutions around the initial guess. It is also free from convergent problems. The approach is demonstrated from electrostatic one-dimensional and three-dimensional dispersion relations, to electromagnetic kinetic magnetized plasma dispersion relation for bi-Maxwellian distribution with parallel velocity drift.<br><br>

Dear, Boys/Girls/Sir/Madam,<br><br>

    I send this to you in case you are interested in it (if not, just ignore it). The manuscript and source code can be found on arXiv (http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2678). See 'Other formats<http://arxiv.org/format/1410.2678v1> ' for the source code: [ Download source<http://arxiv.org/e-print/1410.2678v1> ] , and rename it to '*.tar' and then decompress it.<br><br>

    This is a successor of the general multi-fluid solver PDRF (arXiv:1305.1205<http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1205> or Computer Physics Communications, 2014, 185, 670 - 675). The basic idea of them was mentioned in arXiv:1304.5885<http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5885> .<br><br>

    PDRK includes all the basic kinetic effects (Landau damping, FLR and so  on) and can be accurate for the benchmark of PIC or Vlasov solvers. So, I think it would be more useful than PDRF.<br><br>

    Further comments and suggestions are welcome. Thanks.<br><br>

Best,<br><br>
