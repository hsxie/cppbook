	07:15 Start to code.
	
		  moudle 'variable'; program 'main'; subroutine 'initial', 'plotf', 'plotef',
		  'history', 'efield', 'outputpara', 'efield0', 'efield1', 'efield2', 
		  'efieldcorr'; function 'num2str'.
		  
		  Vlasov solver is Fij99's. Divided to 'shitfx', 'shiftv', 'preps', 'prepe'.
		  
		  Haven't checked.
		  
		  Matlab code 'plot_efx.m', 'plot_fxv.m'(need 'writegif.m') and 'plot_diag.m'
		  for data processing.

	21:23 Vlasov and field solvers are checked. 'efield0' (Fijalkow1999), 'efield1'
		  (Direct difference), and 'efield3(tridiag) give all most the same results.
	      
		  'efield2' (use Ampere's Law) can run, but seems not correct.
		  
		  Benckmark Landau damping and bump-on-tail. Figures are nice. But the exact
		  damping or growth rate are not consist with linear theory. (Normalization 
		  problem??)
		  
2011-08-29
	12:40 Add 'upwindscheme' to solve 'shiftx' of Vlasov. Performance not good: 1st-
		  order, diffusive; 2nd& 3rd, dispersive and errors (caused by boundary
		  condition ??). Tested by 'test_upwind.f90'. Give reasonable results only
		  when dt is small enough (CFL<<1.0).
		  
		  Total lines: 891(with comments).
		  
Need to do:
	1. Find why the Landau damping results are not consist.
	2. Find why the results of Ampere's Law are not correct.
	3. Develope Vlasov solvers other than 'Fij99'.
	4. Add Krook collison, diffusion and drag to Vlasov solver.
	5. Benckmark with Vann2003 and Lesur2010.
	
More to consider:
	1. Parallel implementation. This is a must for big code.
	2. Develope a GK-1D code (PIC or Eulerian). For exercise. To see Alfven waves and 
	so on.
		  
2011-08-30
	07:54 Version 1.01, vlasov_bbmodel_v1.01.f90.
	
	12:00 Add Krook collison, and benckmark with Vann thesis. Use the same parameters,
		  the results are similar: damped, steady state, periodic, chaotic. Nice! But
		  need to check the details of code (some place may incorrect, e.g. 'efield3',
		  the part of Ampere's law). About 52s to run one case(n=63, m=64, nt=30000).
		  
	14:03 Add friction(drag) + diffusion, benchmark with Lesur10. Not consist yet.
